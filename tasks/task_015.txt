# Subtasks:
## 1. Role Definition Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a structured approach to define roles within the application based on organizational needs and access requirements.
### Details:
Audit current access patterns, identify common responsibilities across user groups, create a role hierarchy with clear naming conventions, and document role definitions with descriptions and scope. Include both current and planned departments in your analysis.

## 2. Permission Mapping System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive system to map permissions to roles based on resources and actions.
### Details:
Identify all resources requiring access control, define granular actions for each resource (create, read, update, delete), create a permission matrix connecting roles to resource-action pairs, and implement a mechanism to handle permission inheritance and conflicts.

## 3. UI Access Control Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement interface-level and component-level access control to dynamically adjust UI elements based on user roles.
### Details:
Create a UI permission framework that conditionally renders components, develop role-based navigation systems, implement visual indicators for permission-restricted elements, and ensure graceful handling of unauthorized access attempts at the interface level.

## 4. API Access Control Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop a robust API authorization layer to enforce role-based permissions at the query and endpoint levels.
### Details:
Implement middleware for role validation on API endpoints, develop query-level filtering based on user permissions, create a token validation system that extracts and verifies role claims, and establish consistent error handling for unauthorized API requests.

## 5. Role Assignment Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Create administrative interfaces and processes for assigning and managing user roles.
### Details:
Develop an administrative interface for role management, implement approval workflows for role changes, create bulk assignment capabilities for organizational changes, and establish role expiration and review mechanisms for temporary access needs.

## 6. Audit Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive logging of all role-based access events for security compliance and troubleshooting.
### Details:
Create detailed logging for all permission checks and access attempts, develop audit reports for compliance requirements, implement alerting for suspicious access patterns, and establish retention policies for audit logs based on regulatory requirements.
