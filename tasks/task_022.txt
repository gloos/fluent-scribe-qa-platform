# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Custom Scoring Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow users to define custom scoring models for quality assessment.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Model Definition Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user-friendly interface for defining scoring model parameters and structure
### Details:
Design and implement an intuitive UI for users to define scoring models, including field selection, model naming, and basic configuration options. Include visualization components to represent the model structure and ensure the interface supports both simple and complex model creation workflows.

## 2. Weighting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Develop a flexible weighting mechanism for assigning importance to different scoring criteria
### Details:
Implement a system that allows users to assign percentage-based weights to different criteria, ensuring they sum to 100%. Include visual indicators of weight distribution, drag-and-drop reordering, and the ability to normalize weights automatically when adding or removing criteria.

## 3. Formula Builder [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Create an advanced formula construction tool for custom scoring calculations
### Details:
Develop a formula builder with support for mathematical operations, conditional logic, and reference functions. Include a library of common formulas, syntax highlighting, error checking, and a testing environment to validate formula outputs with sample data.

## 4. Validation Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Implement a system for defining and enforcing data validation within scoring models
### Details:
Create a framework for setting up validation rules that ensure data integrity and prevent calculation errors. Include threshold settings, acceptable ranges, required field validation, and custom validation logic with appropriate error messaging for users.

## 5. Template Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2, 22.3
### Description: Build functionality for saving, sharing, and reusing scoring model templates
### Details:
Develop a template system allowing users to save custom scoring models as reusable templates with versioning support. Include categorization, search functionality, permission controls for sharing, and the ability to clone and modify existing templates.

## 6. Comparison Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4, 22.5
### Description: Create tools for comparing multiple scoring models and their outcomes
### Details:
Implement visualization and analysis tools that allow users to compare different scoring models side by side. Include difference highlighting, sensitivity analysis, scenario testing capabilities, and exportable comparison reports with actionable insights.

## 7. Documentation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.5, 22.6
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation capabilities for scoring models
### Details:
Create a documentation framework that captures model definitions, formulas, weights, validation rules, and usage guidelines. Include annotation capabilities, change history tracking, export options for documentation, and integration with existing knowledge management systems.
