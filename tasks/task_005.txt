# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop User Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement secure user registration and login system with role-based access control.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement User Registration Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the process for new users to register, including input validation, password strength enforcement, and email/identity verification.
### Details:
Define required registration fields (e.g., username, email, password). Implement input validation and error handling. Enforce strong password policies. Integrate email or multi-factor verification for account activation. Store user credentials securely using hashing and salting.

## 2. Develop Secure Login System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build the login mechanism to authenticate users, handle credential validation, and manage authentication errors.
### Details:
Implement login form with secure credential transmission (e.g., HTTPS). Validate user credentials against stored hashes. Provide clear error messages without revealing sensitive information. Integrate account lockout or throttling after repeated failed attempts.

## 3. Implement Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Establish secure session handling for authenticated users, including session creation, expiration, and invalidation.
### Details:
Generate secure session tokens upon successful login. Store session tokens securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies). Set session expiration and renewal policies. Implement logout functionality to invalidate sessions. Protect against session fixation and hijacking.

## 4. Set Up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Define user roles and permissions, and enforce access restrictions based on assigned roles.
### Details:
Identify system roles (e.g., user, admin, moderator). Map permissions to roles for various resources and actions. Integrate role checks into authentication and authorization flows. Ensure unauthorized users cannot access restricted resources.

## 5. Integrate Security Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Apply security best practices to protect authentication flows and user data.
### Details:
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) options. Use secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Enforce HTTPS for all authentication endpoints. Monitor and log authentication events for auditing. Regularly review and update security policies.

## 6. Develop User Profile Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Enable users to view and update their profile information securely.
### Details:
Create interfaces for users to view and edit their profile data. Validate and sanitize all profile updates. Allow users to change passwords and manage MFA settings. Ensure only authenticated users can access and modify their own profiles.
