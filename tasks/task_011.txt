# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a drag-and-drop interface for uploading XLIFF files with real-time progress tracking.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Drag-and-Drop Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a drag-and-drop file upload interface
### Details:
Create HTML structure with a drop zone and hidden file input. Style the drop zone with visual cues for drag states. Implement event handlers for dragover, dragleave, and drop events using the DragEvent interface. Add click functionality to open the file dialog when the drop zone is clicked.

After analyzing the codebase, we've discovered two existing drag-and-drop implementations:

1. FileUpload Component (src/components/forms/FileUpload.tsx):
   - Reusable component using react-dropzone
   - Includes validation, progress tracking, error handling, file removal
   - Supports XLIFF files with proper MIME type detection
   - Has TypeScript interfaces and prop structure

2. Upload Page (src/pages/Upload.tsx):
   - Standalone implementation also using react-dropzone
   - Contains simulated upload/processing logic
   - Duplicates functionality already in FileUpload component

Instead of creating a new implementation, we should:
- Refactor Upload page to use the existing FileUpload component
- Enhance FileUpload component with real upload functionality
- Add cancellation and improved error recovery
- Integrate with existing uploadFile API from storage.ts
- Implement comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms

This approach eliminates code duplication while improving the upload experience.

**Analysis of Current File Validation Implementation**

After reviewing the existing code in the enhanced FileUpload component and useFileUpload hook, I can see that basic file validation is already implemented, but there are areas for enhancement:

**Currently Implemented:**

- ✅ File size validation (50MB limit)  
- ✅ Max files count validation (10 files)
- ✅ Error message display for invalid files
- ✅ Prevention of invalid files from upload processing

**Areas for Enhancement:**
1. **MIME Type Validation**: Add proper MIME type checking beyond just file extensions
2. **File Content Validation**: Basic XLIFF structure validation
3. **Duplicate File Detection**: Prevent uploading same file multiple times
4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: More descriptive, actionable error messages
5. **File Name Validation**: Check for invalid characters and length limits
6. **Security Validation**: Additional security checks for file safety

**Implementation Plan:**
- Enhance the validateFile function in FileUpload component
- Add MIME type validation using the File API
- Implement duplicate detection based on file name + size + last modified
- Create better error message system with specific guidance
- Add optional XLIFF content structure validation
