## Initial Exploration & Analysis

### Current MQM Taxonomy Structure
The existing system implements MQM 2.0 based on ISO DIS 5060:2024 with:

**7 Main Dimensions:**
1. TERMINOLOGY (3 categories)
2. ACCURACY (5 categories) 
3. LINGUISTIC_CONVENTIONS (10 categories)
4. STYLE (4 categories)
5. LOCALE_CONVENTIONS (7 categories)
6. AUDIENCE_APPROPRIATENESS (3 categories)
7. DESIGN_AND_MARKUP (6 categories)

**Total: 38 base categories**

**Current Limitations Identified:**
1. Limited granularity in leaf nodes, especially in Accuracy/Mistranslation and Style categories
2. No domain-specific distinctions within categories
3. Substitution errors not explicitly separated (mentioned in task details as needing attention)
4. No hierarchical subcategories beyond the dimension ‚Üí category level

### Research-Based Expansion Plan
Based on academic literature and industry standards, I need to focus on:

1. **Substitution Category Expansion** - Creating granular subcategories for different types of substitution errors
2. **Domain-Specific Adaptations** - Allow categories to have domain-specific variations
3. **Hierarchical Structure** - Add intermediate levels between dimensions and categories
4. **Consensus Categories** - Standardize error types across different domains

Next step: Research current best practices and create the expansion framework structure.
