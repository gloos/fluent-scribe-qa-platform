# Task ID: 13
# Title: Enhance Error Categorization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop advanced error categorization with severity classification.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Taxonomy Expansion Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive framework for expanding the error taxonomy with increased granularity at leaf nodes
### Details:
Analyze existing taxonomies from research papers to identify consensus categories. Focus on standardizing error types across different domains. Pay special attention to the Substitution category which has been noted to benefit from increased granularity. Create hierarchical structure that allows for domain-specific distinctions.

## 2. Implement Severity Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Design and implement a multi-level severity classification system for categorized errors
### Details:
Define severity levels (e.g., critical, major, minor) with clear criteria for each level. Create decision trees for severity assignment based on error impact. Develop weighting mechanisms for different error types based on their impact on system functionality. Include context-aware severity adjustment rules.

## 3. Develop Error Detection Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create algorithms to automatically identify and classify errors according to the expanded taxonomy
### Details:
Research machine learning approaches for error detection across different text types. Implement pattern recognition for common error categories. Develop NLP-based detection methods for semantic and contextual errors. Create validation mechanisms to verify algorithm accuracy against human annotations.

## 4. Establish Categorization Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Define comprehensive rules for consistent error categorization across different domains and use cases
### Details:
Create decision flowcharts for ambiguous error classification scenarios. Develop guidelines for handling errors that span multiple categories. Establish protocols for domain-specific categorization adaptations. Document edge cases with examples for training purposes.

## 5. Design User Feedback Integration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Create mechanisms to incorporate user feedback into the error categorization process
### Details:
Develop interfaces for collecting structured feedback on error categorizations. Create workflows for reviewing and incorporating feedback into the taxonomy. Implement version control for tracking taxonomy changes based on feedback. Design metrics to measure taxonomy effectiveness based on user input.

## 6. Create Enhanced Reporting Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.4, 13.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive reporting tools that leverage the expanded taxonomy and severity classifications
### Details:
Design dashboards for visualizing error distributions across categories. Create trend analysis reports to track error patterns over time. Implement drill-down capabilities for detailed error investigation. Develop automated recommendations based on error patterns and severity distributions.
