# Title: Optimize Performance for Large Files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure efficient processing of large XLIFF files with real-time progress tracking.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Chunking Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a method to divide large files into manageable chunks for efficient processing and transfer. Determine optimal chunk size based on file size, system memory, and network conditions. Ensure support for resumable and parallel uploads.
### Details:
Analyze file size distribution and system constraints to select chunk size. Implement file slicing logic. Ensure each chunk can be independently processed and reassembled. Consider edge cases such as last chunk size and error handling.

## 2. Develop Worker Implementation for Parallel Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create a worker pool or multithreading mechanism to process or upload file chunks concurrently, maximizing CPU and network utilization.
### Details:
Design a system to distribute chunk processing/upload tasks among multiple workers. Implement logic to manage worker lifecycle, handle failures, and balance load. Ensure thread safety and efficient resource usage.

## 3. Optimize Memory Management During Chunk Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Implement strategies to minimize memory footprint during chunk processing, such as streaming, buffer reuse, and timely garbage collection.
### Details:
Profile memory usage during chunk processing. Use streaming APIs where possible. Release memory for processed chunks promptly. Monitor for memory leaks and optimize buffer allocation.

## 4. Implement Progress Tracking and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Develop mechanisms to monitor and report the progress of chunk processing and uploads, providing real-time feedback to users or systems.
### Details:
Track the status of each chunk (pending, in-progress, completed, failed). Aggregate progress across all chunks. Provide hooks or callbacks for UI updates or logging. Handle retries and error reporting.

## 5. Integrate Caching Mechanisms for Chunks and Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Design and implement caching strategies to store processed chunks or intermediate results, reducing redundant computation and improving fault tolerance.
### Details:
Determine cache scope (in-memory, disk, distributed). Implement cache eviction and consistency policies. Support resumable operations by persisting chunk states. Optimize cache lookup and storage performance.

## 6. Conduct Benchmark Testing and Performance Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4, 21.5
### Description: Set up comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the optimization strategies, including throughput, latency, resource usage, and scalability.
### Details:
Define test scenarios with varying file sizes and system loads. Measure key metrics before and after optimizations. Analyze bottlenecks and iterate on design. Document results and recommendations.
