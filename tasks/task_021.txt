## Initial Exploration & Analysis

### Current File Processing Architecture
After examining the codebase, I've identified the current file processing flow:

1. **File Upload**: `src/components/forms/FileUpload.tsx` handles drag & drop with max 50MB per file
2. **Storage**: `src/lib/storage.ts` uploads entire files to Supabase Storage using standard upload API
3. **Processing**: `src/lib/qa-processing.ts` downloads and processes complete files in memory
4. **XLIFF Parsing**: `src/lib/xliff-processing.ts` reads entire file content into memory for parsing

### Current Limitations Identified
- **Memory bottleneck**: Entire file content loaded into memory (`await data.text()`)
- **No chunking**: Files processed as single units regardless of size
- **Download blocking**: Full file download required before any processing begins
- **No resumability**: Failed uploads/processing require complete restart
- **No parallel processing**: Single-threaded file processing

### Proposed Chunking Strategy Design

**1. Chunk Size Calculation**
- Base chunk size: 5MB for files < 50MB
- Dynamic sizing: Math.min(fileSize / 8, 10MB) for larger files
- Memory constraint: Never exceed 25% of available system memory
- Network adaptive: Adjust based on upload speed (slower = smaller chunks)

**2. File Slicing Implementation**
- Use File.slice() API for client-side chunking
- Sequential chunk numbering with metadata
- Checksum validation per chunk
- Support for resuming from last successful chunk

**3. Chunk Processing Pipeline**
- Independent chunk upload to Supabase Storage with unique paths
- Server-side chunk reassembly before XLIFF parsing
- Progress tracking per chunk and overall file
- Error isolation (failed chunk doesn't affect others)

### Technical Implementation Plan
1. Create `ChunkingService` class in `src/lib/chunking/`
2. Modify `useFileUpload` hook to support chunked uploads
3. Add chunk reassembly logic to server-side processing
4. Implement progress tracking and resumability
5. Add chunk-level caching for retry scenarios

**3. Task Distribution System**
- Task serialization for worker communication
- Result aggregation from multiple workers

- Concurrent validation of uploaded chunks

**5. Synchronization Mechanisms**

## 3. Optimize Memory Management During Chunk Processing [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Implement strategies to minimize memory footprint during chunk processing, such as streaming, buffer reuse, and timely garbage collection.

<info added on 2025-06-02T20:56:05.502Z>
## Initial Analysis: Current Memory Management Issues

### Memory Bottlenecks Identified:

**1. Full File Loading in Memory**
- `fetchXLIFFFileContent()` loads entire file via `data.text()` - no streaming
- `readFileContent()` in BatchProcessor uses FileReader to load complete file
- `ChunkingService.uploadSingleChunk()` creates full Blob slices in memory simultaneously

**2. Concurrent Memory Accumulation**
- WorkerPool processes up to 6 chunks concurrently, each holding full Blob data
- No memory cleanup between chunk processing cycles
- Progress trackers and job results accumulated indefinitely
- Multiple checksum calculations happening simultaneously

**3. No Memory Pressure Detection**
- No monitoring of browser memory usage
- No adaptive chunk sizing based on available memory
- No garbage collection triggering after chunk completion

**4. Inefficient Buffer Management**
- Chunk Blobs created but not explicitly released
- Multiple copies of chunk data during checksum calculation
- No buffer reuse patterns for similar-sized chunks

### Target Optimizations:
1. Implement streaming for file reading where possible
2. Add memory pressure detection and adaptive sizing
3. Implement buffer pooling for chunk processing
4. Add explicit garbage collection hints
5. Implement progressive memory cleanup during processing
</info added on 2025-06-02T20:56:05.502Z>

- Each chunk has unique ID, checksum validation, and upload path tracking
- Progress tracking via `ProgressTracker.ts` with comprehensive metrics
- No current caching - each upload starts fresh, no resume capability

### Caching Strategy Design
Based on best practices for file chunking systems, implementing multi-layer cache:

**Layer 1: In-Memory Cache**
- Hot cache for active operations (current session)
- LRU eviction based on memory pressure
- Fast lookup for chunk metadata and upload states

**Layer 2: IndexedDB Persistent Cache**
- Cross-session chunk state persistence for resumability
- Chunk content caching for failed uploads
- Cache invalidation based on file modification time/checksum

**Layer 3: Progress State Cache**
- Persistent upload progress for interrupted operations  
- Metadata caching for partially uploaded files
- Recovery state management

### Implementation Plan
1. Create `src/lib/chunking/cache/` directory structure
2. Implement `CacheManager` with multi-layer support
3. Add cache integration to `ChunkingService.ts`
4. Extend progress tracking with cache hit/miss metrics
5. Add resumable upload logic using cached chunk states
