# Filter Implementation Analysis

## Current State:
- Reports.tsx has basic filtering: search term, status filter, and language filter
- AdvancedFilters.tsx component exists but uses mock data and the useReportFilters hook
- Current filtering in Reports.tsx is simple: searchTerm.toLowerCase(), statusFilter, languageFilter
- The Reports page fetches real data from Supabase qa_sessions table
- The "More Filters" button exists but doesn't seem to be connected to AdvancedFilters

## Key Files to Modify:
1. src/pages/Reports.tsx - Replace basic filtering with comprehensive system
2. src/components/filters/AdvancedFilters.tsx - Connect to real data, enhance filters
3. src/hooks/useReportFilters.ts - Update to work with real report data instead of mock data

## Implementation Strategy:
1. Connect the "More Filters" button to the AdvancedFilters component
2. Update the FilterState interface to match ReportFile properties (add fileType, modelUsed, etc)
3. Replace the mock data in useReportFilters with actual reports data
4. Add new filter options for error type, severity, score ranges, date ranges
5. Enhance the filtering logic to support complex filter combinations
6. Add saved filter configurations
7. Implement filter state persistence

## Additional Enhancements:
- Add error type filters (if error data is more granular)
- Add severity filters (based on score ranges)
- Add file type filters (XLIFF, TMX, etc)
- Add model-based filtering
- Add date range filtering
- Add file size filtering
- Add segment count filtering

## 2. Dynamic Data Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Build flexible visualization components that update in real-time based on data changes
### Details:
Develop a suite of visualization options (charts, graphs, tables) that dynamically update when data or filters change. Implement client-side rendering for performance and ensure visualizations are responsive across different screen sizes. Include options for users to customize visualization appearance and behavior.

# Dynamic Data Visualization Analysis

## Current State Assessment:
- Reports.tsx currently only displays data in a static table format
- Recharts library is available and already used in existing chart components
- Chart UI wrapper component is available with theming support
- 4 existing chart components exist but they use mock data: ReportsOverviewChart, QualityDistributionChart, IssueAnalysisChart, ProcessingEfficiencyChart
- Current filtering system from subtask 14.1 provides filtered data that can drive dynamic visualizations

## Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Create Dynamic Data Aggregation
1. Build utility functions to transform filtered report data into chart-ready formats
2. Create data aggregation hooks for different visualization types
3. Ensure real-time responsiveness to filter changes

### Phase 2: Enhance Existing Charts with Dynamic Data
1. Update existing chart components to accept real data props
2. Remove mock data and connect to actual filtered report data
3. Add responsive sizing and layout options

### Phase 3: Create Interactive Visualization Components
1. Build view toggles (Table/Charts/Mixed views)
2. Create chart type selection (Bar, Line, Pie, etc.)
3. Add customization options for chart appearance

### Phase 4: Responsive Layout System
1. Implement grid-based layout for multiple charts
2. Add responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop
3. Create print-friendly visualizations
