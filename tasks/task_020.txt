# Subtasks:
## 1. Password Reset Flow Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a secure password reset mechanism that prevents vulnerabilities while maintaining usability
### Details:
Develop a secure token generation system, implement expiration controls, create secure email delivery, add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, and ensure proper validation of reset requests to mitigate complexity-related vulnerabilities

## 2. Two-Factor Authentication Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement a robust 2FA system with multiple authentication options while managing complexity
### Details:
Select appropriate 2FA methods (TOTP, SMS, email), implement secure token generation and validation, create recovery mechanisms, integrate with existing authentication flow, and conduct complexity assessment to identify potential hidden vulnerabilities

## 3. Session Management Enhancement [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Develop secure session handling mechanisms with proper timeout and validation controls
### Details:
Implement secure session token generation, establish appropriate timeout policies, create session invalidation mechanisms, add device fingerprinting, and conduct complexity analysis to identify interdependencies that could create security weaknesses

## 4. Security Headers Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Configure and implement appropriate HTTP security headers to enhance application security posture
### Details:
Implement Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and other relevant headers while analyzing the complexity impact of each configuration on the overall system

## 5. Vulnerability Scanning System [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Set up automated vulnerability scanning processes to identify security weaknesses
### Details:
Select appropriate scanning tools, configure scanning schedules, establish severity classification system, implement reporting mechanisms, and develop a complexity-informed approach to prioritize vulnerability remediation

## 6. Penetration Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.5
### Description: Develop a comprehensive penetration testing methodology to identify exploitable vulnerabilities
### Details:
Define testing scope, select testing methodologies, establish reporting templates, create remediation tracking system, and incorporate complexity analysis to identify potential hidden vulnerabilities that might be overlooked in standard testing

## 7. Security Documentation Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6
### Description: Create comprehensive security documentation covering all implemented security controls and processes
### Details:
Document security architecture, create user guides for security features, develop incident response procedures, establish security policy documentation, and include complexity assessments to help identify potential security weaknesses in the system design
