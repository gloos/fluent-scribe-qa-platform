## Initial Analysis - Current Security Headers Status

**Existing Security Headers Implementation:**

1. **Helmet.js** - Basic configuration with defaults:
   - Location: `src/server/app.ts:243` - `app.use(helmet())`
   - Provides basic security headers with default values

2. **Custom Security Headers** via `ApiAuthMiddleware.securityHeaders()`:
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
   - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
   - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
   - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

**What's Missing for Enhanced Security:**
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)** - Not configured specifically
2. **Permissions Policy** - Not configured
3. **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control** - Not explicitly set
4. **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy** - Not configured
5. **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy** - Not configured

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and enhance Helmet.js configuration with specific CSP rules
2. Add additional modern security headers
3. Ensure compatibility with existing CORS configuration
4. Test with the frontend to ensure no functionality is broken
