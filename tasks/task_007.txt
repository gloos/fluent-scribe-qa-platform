# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement XLIFF File Parsing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to parse XLIFF 1.2, 2.0, and MXLIFF files.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Common Parser Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a modular architecture for XLIFF parsing that can handle different XLIFF versions
### Details:
Define core interfaces and abstract classes for parsing XML-based XLIFF files. Implement factory pattern for version-specific parsers. Create data models to represent XLIFF elements (file, trans-unit, source, target). Design validation interfaces that can be implemented by version-specific validators.

## 2. Implement XLIFF 1.2 Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop parser for XLIFF 1.2 specification with support for all required elements
### Details:
Parse top-level and header elements. Handle named group elements and structural elements. Support translation units with source and target elements. Implement custom attribute handling for extensions like 'cmxliff:target'. Process file sections according to the XLIFF 1.2 standard.

## 3. Implement XLIFF 2.0 Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop parser for XLIFF 2.0 specification with support for its unique features
### Details:
Implement support for modules (core, translation candidates, glossary, etc.). Handle the new segmentation approach in XLIFF 2.0. Support metadata and resource data sections. Process inline markup and preserve formatting. Implement namespace handling specific to XLIFF 2.0.

## 4. Add MXLIFF Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Extend the parser to handle Microsoft XLIFF (MXLIFF) format variations
### Details:
Implement Microsoft-specific extensions and attributes. Handle MXLIFF-specific metadata. Support state attributes and translation state tracking. Process MXLIFF-specific inline codes and placeholders. Implement roundtrip conversion between standard XLIFF and MXLIFF.

## 5. Implement Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create comprehensive validation for XLIFF files against schemas and business rules
### Details:
Validate against XML schemas for each XLIFF version. Implement semantic validation for translation units. Check for required attributes and elements. Validate language codes and formatting. Implement custom validation rules for specific project requirements.

## 6. Develop Error Handling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Create robust error handling for parsing, validation, and processing failures
### Details:
Implement hierarchical error classification system. Create detailed error messages with line/position information. Develop recovery strategies for non-critical errors. Implement logging system for parsing issues. Create error reporting mechanism for end users with actionable feedback.
