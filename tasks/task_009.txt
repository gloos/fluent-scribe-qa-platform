## 1. Define MQM Error Taxonomy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive taxonomy of error types and subtypes based on MQM standards, ensuring each error type is clearly described and mapped to project requirements.
### Details:
Reference MQM-Full and MQM-Core to select relevant error dimensions and subtypes. Document definitions and ensure alignment with industry terminology.
<info added on 2025-05-30T09:07:30.526Z>
The MQM error taxonomy implementation has been completed with the following components:

1. Complete type system in `src/lib/types/assessment.ts`:
   - 7 main MQM dimensions (Terminology, Accuracy, Linguistic Conventions, Style, Locale Conventions, Audience Appropriateness, Design and Markup)
   - 33+ specific error categories organized by dimension
   - MQMSeverity enum with standard penalty weights (Minor=1, Major=5, Critical=10, Neutral=0)
   - Comprehensive interfaces for error definitions, instances, configuration, and scoring

2. Constants library in `src/lib/constants/mqm-taxonomy.ts`:
   - Detailed error definitions with examples for 18+ common error types
   - Dimension-to-category mapping for validation
   - Quality threshold definitions (excellent, good, fair, poor, unacceptable)
   - Default configuration templates
   - Utility functions for error key generation and validation

3. Industry standard compliance:
   - Based on MQM 2.0 / ISO DIS 5060:2024 standards
   - Follows themqm.org taxonomy structure
   - Implements standard penalty scoring system

4. Practical examples for various error types across languages and formatting conventions

This implementation provides the foundation for the severity classification system to be developed in the next subtask.

## 2. Establish Severity Classification System [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a standardized system for classifying the severity of each error type, including clear criteria for each severity level.
### Details:
Define severity levels (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical) and provide guidelines for evaluators to consistently assign severity to errors within the taxonomy.
<info added on 2025-05-30T09:09:25.054Z>
# Severity Classification System

## Severity Levels
- **Neutral**: Opportunities for improvement without negative impact
- **Minor**: Errors with minimal impact on user experience or understanding
- **Major**: Errors that significantly affect comprehension or usability
- **Critical**: Errors that render content unusable, cause functional failures, or create serious business risks

## Implementation Details
- Created comprehensive framework in `src/lib/utils/mqm-severity-classifier.ts`
- Defined impact assessment criteria across user experience, functional, and business dimensions
- Established dimension-specific severity triggers for all 7 MQM dimensions
- Implemented context-based severity modifiers for 6 content types (safety-critical, legal-regulatory, financial-transactional, UI-critical-path, marketing-promotional, decorative-supplementary)

## MQMSeverityClassifier Engine
- Automated severity suggestion system with confidence scoring
- Severity validation with warnings and suggestions
- Assessment reasoning with explanation for recommended severities
- Alternative severity options for evaluator consideration

## Training and Consistency Tools
- Comprehensive examples for each severity level
- Real-world scenarios with reasoning explanations
- Dimension-specific examples for consistent assessment
- Validation tools to identify common misclassification patterns

## Industry Compliance
- Follows MQM 2.0 standard severity definitions
- Implements business impact assessment criteria
- Supports safety-critical and regulatory content classification
- Provides clear escalation criteria for critical errors

## 3. Design Scoring Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop the algorithm that calculates quality scores based on error counts, severity, and normalization parameters.
### Details:
Implement linear and calibrated scoring models as per MQM 2.0, including normalization by evaluation word count, reference word count, and penalty scalars. Ensure the algorithm supports both raw and calibrated scoring outputs.
<info added on 2025-05-30T09:15:07.210Z>
The MQM scoring algorithm has been fully implemented in `src/lib/utils/mqm-scoring-engine.ts` with both linear and calibrated scoring models. The implementation includes:

1. Linear scoring with proper penalty accumulation based on severity weights
2. Calibrated scoring with content type, domain-specific, and criticality-based adjustments
3. Normalization by word count, reference word count, and configurable scoring units
4. Statistical features including confidence intervals and variance calculations
5. Comprehensive breakdowns by dimension, severity, and category

Key components include the `MQMScoringEngine` class with methods for linear, calibrated, and batch scoring, along with helper utilities and a factory for pre-configured engines. The implementation is production-ready, fully compliant with MQM 2.0 standards, and integrates with the existing taxonomy and severity classification systems.

## 4. Develop Weighting System [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Define and implement a weighting system that assigns different weights to error types and severity levels according to project or stakeholder priorities.
### Details:
Allow for customization of weights for error types and severities. Document the rationale and provide configuration options for different evaluation scenarios.
<info added on 2025-05-30T09:18:59.432Z>
## Analysis Phase - Current Weighting Implementation

Current MQM weighting system analysis:

### Existing Infrastructure
1. **Basic dimension weights** - Already implemented in `MQMAssessmentConfig.dimension_weights` (optional field)
2. **Severity weights** - Standard MQM penalties in `DEFAULT_MQM_PENALTIES` (Minor=1, Major=5, Critical=10, Neutral=0)
3. **Scoring engine** - `MQMScoringEngine` already supports dimension weighting in `calculateDimensionBreakdown()`
4. **Content-based calibration** - Domain and content type adjustments exist but limited

### Gaps Identified
1. **Category-level weighting** - No granular weighting by error category
2. **Project-specific weight templates** - No predefined weighting profiles for different use cases
3. **Stakeholder priority mapping** - No way to reflect business priorities in weights
4. **Dynamic weight adjustment** - No context-aware weighting based on project metadata
5. **Weight validation** - No validation or normalization of custom weights
6. **Documentation/rationale** - Limited guidance for weight configuration

### Implementation Plan
1. Extend type system to support category-level and project-specific weights
2. Create predefined weighting profiles for common scenarios
3. Implement weight validation and normalization utilities
4. Add comprehensive weight configuration management
5. Document rationale and provide configuration guidance
