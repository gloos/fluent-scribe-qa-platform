# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Batch File Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable batch processing of multiple XLIFF files.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Queue Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a system to collect, prioritize, and schedule data batches for processing
### Details:
Create a queue management system that handles data collection from various sources, groups tasks based on predefined criteria, and schedules them for execution at optimal intervals. Include mechanisms for batch prioritization and resource allocation to ensure efficient processing.

## 2. Develop Parallel Processing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a framework for executing batch tasks concurrently to optimize resource utilization
### Details:
Design a system that determines whether batches should be processed sequentially or in parallel based on system capacity and requirements. Implement resource allocation algorithms to prevent system overload while maximizing throughput for large data volumes.

## 3. Build Progress Tracking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Implement a system to monitor and report on the status of batch processing jobs
### Details:
Develop a monitoring system that tracks the progress of each batch job through its lifecycle, from queue to completion. Include metrics collection for performance analysis, real-time status updates, and visualization tools to provide stakeholders with visibility into processing status.

## 4. Establish Error Handling Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create robust error detection, logging, and recovery mechanisms for batch processing failures
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling that includes detection of processing failures, detailed logging of error conditions, retry mechanisms for transient failures, and graceful degradation options. Design the system to maintain data integrity even when errors occur.

## 5. Develop Results Aggregation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Build a framework to collect, store, and distribute the output of completed batch processes
### Details:
Create a system that aggregates and stores processing results, generates appropriate reports or data transformations, and distributes outputs to relevant systems or stakeholders. Include data validation mechanisms and integration points with downstream systems.
