# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Load Testing Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a database load testing environment with appropriate tools and realistic test data
### Details:
Set up JMeter or similar load testing tool with JDBC connectivity. Create test data that closely mirrors production data. Configure the test environment to match production settings. Establish baseline performance metrics for comparison.

## 2. Database Query Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Identify and optimize inefficient database queries to improve performance under load
### Details:
Analyze execution plans for frequently run queries. Implement appropriate indexing strategies for commonly queried columns. Consider table partitioning for large datasets. Optimize SQL statements to reduce resource consumption and improve response times.

## 3. Load Testing Scenario Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create comprehensive test scenarios that simulate various real-world usage patterns
### Details:
Develop multiple test scenarios covering read, write, and update operations. Create tests for both peak and off-peak usage periods. Implement incremental load testing to identify performance thresholds. Automate test execution for consistency and repeatability.

## 4. Resource Monitoring Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring of server and database resources during load testing
### Details:
Configure monitoring for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage. Establish alerting thresholds for critical resource constraints. Create dashboards for real-time visibility into system performance. Implement logging for post-test analysis.

## 5. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3, 24.4
### Description: Analyze test results to identify performance bottlenecks and prioritize optimization efforts
### Details:
Compare test results against established performance goals. Identify queries or operations with the highest resource consumption. Determine resource bottlenecks affecting overall system performance. Prioritize optimization efforts based on impact and implementation complexity.

## 6. Caching Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2, 24.5
### Description: Design and implement appropriate caching mechanisms to reduce database load
### Details:
Identify frequently accessed data suitable for caching. Select appropriate caching technologies (in-memory, distributed, etc.). Implement cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency. Configure cache size and expiration policies based on usage patterns.

## 7. Server Autoscaling Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4, 24.5
### Description: Set up automatic scaling of server resources based on load patterns
### Details:
Define autoscaling policies based on resource utilization metrics. Configure scaling thresholds for both scale-up and scale-down events. Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across scaled resources. Test autoscaling behavior under various load conditions.

## 8. CDN Integration and Content Delivery Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.5, 24.7
### Description: Implement CDN services to improve content delivery and reduce server load
### Details:
Identify static content suitable for CDN delivery. Select appropriate CDN provider based on geographic requirements. Configure origin pull and cache invalidation policies. Implement performance monitoring for CDN-delivered content.
