The missing pieces are:\n1. XML Schema (XSD) validation integration\n2. Version-specific validator implementations in `ValidatorFactory`\n3. Performance optimizations for large files\n4.

Version-specific schema validation against actual XSD files\n2. Enhanced business rules validation for project-specific needs  \n3. Performance optimizations for large files\n4.

Key Features Implemented\n- **Backward compatibility**: Existing MQM 2.0 structure preserved and extended\n- **Domain-specific filtering**: Categories can be filtered by domain relevance\n- **Configurable expansion**: Enable/disable subcategories and domain-specific features\n- **Comprehensive substitution taxonomy**: Addresses task requirement for substitution error granularity\n- **Research-based categorization**: Based on linguistic analysis and translation quality research\n\n### 4. Expansion Results\n- **Base categories**: 38 existing MQM categories preserved\n- **New subcategories**: 39+ additional granular categories added\n- **Total hierarchy levels**: 4 (dimension → category → subcategory → leaf)\n- **Domain coverage**: 10 specialized domains supported\n- **Substitution focus**: 15 detailed substitution types (as required in task details)\n\n### 5. Next Steps for Integration\n- Create enhanced error definitions with examples for new subcategories\n- Integrate with existing MQM scoring engine\n- Add ML-based automatic categorization\n- Build UI components for hierarchical category selection\n- Implement domain-specific weighting profiles\n\nThe framework successfully addresses the core requirements:\n✅ Increased granularity at leaf nodes\n✅ Domain-specific distinctions  \n✅ Enhanced substitution error categorization\n✅ Hierarchical structure beyond dimension → category\n✅ Consensus categories standardized across domains\n\nReady to proceed with integration into the existing assessment system.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T19:16:22.826Z>",
