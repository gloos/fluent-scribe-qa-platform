The missing pieces are:\n1. XML Schema (XSD) validation integration\n2. Version-specific validator implementations in `ValidatorFactory`\n3. Performance optimizations for large files\n4.

Version-specific schema validation against actual XSD files\n2. Enhanced business rules validation for project-specific needs  \n3. Performance optimizations for large files\n4.
