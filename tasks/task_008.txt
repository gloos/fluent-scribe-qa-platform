# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Large Language Models for linguistic analysis and error detection.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. API Connection Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish secure and reliable connectivity to the LLM provider's API, including authentication, endpoint configuration, and network considerations.
### Details:
Register for API keys, configure endpoints, set up secure HTTP(S) connections, and validate connectivity with test requests.

## 2. Prompt Engineering [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design, test, and refine prompts to maximize LLM output quality and relevance for target use cases.
### Details:
Develop prompt templates, experiment with phrasing and context, and iterate based on output analysis to ensure consistent and accurate responses.

## 3. Response Parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement logic to extract, validate, and structure relevant information from LLM responses for downstream processing.
### Details:
Parse raw LLM outputs, handle different response formats, and map extracted data to application-specific structures.

## 4. Error Detection Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop mechanisms to identify, classify, and handle errors or anomalies in LLM interactions and outputs.
### Details:
Detect API errors, malformed responses, hallucinations, or low-confidence outputs using rule-based and statistical methods.

## 5. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Optimize the integration for latency, throughput, and resource utilization to ensure efficient LLM interactions.
### Details:
Implement request batching, caching, concurrency controls, and monitor performance metrics to identify bottlenecks.

## 6. Cost Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Monitor and control API usage to manage operational costs associated with LLM queries.
### Details:
Track API call volumes, set usage quotas, implement cost alerts, and optimize prompt/response sizes to reduce expenses.

## 7. Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement strategies to gracefully handle LLM failures or degraded performance.
### Details:
Define fallback workflows, such as default responses, alternative models, or user notifications, to maintain service continuity.
