# Task ID: 6
# Title: Design Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a database schema for user accounts, project metadata, and quality assessment results.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design User Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive user data structures with appropriate fields and normalization
### Details:
Define user entity tables with primary keys, determine required attributes (name, contact info, credentials), establish appropriate data types and constraints, implement security considerations for sensitive data, and create documentation for the user schema

## 2. Develop Project Metadata Structures [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Design schema components for storing project-related information
### Details:
Define project entity tables with unique identifiers, determine metadata fields (creation date, status, description), establish relationships with user data models, implement versioning strategy if needed, and ensure proper indexing for efficient queries

## 3. Create Assessment Results Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Design schema for storing and retrieving assessment data efficiently
### Details:
Define assessment result tables with appropriate primary keys, determine data structure for various result types, implement normalization to prevent redundancy, establish timestamp fields for tracking, and design for scalability with potentially large datasets

## 4. Define Relationships Between Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Establish proper relationships between all schema components
### Details:
Identify one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, implement foreign key constraints, ensure referential integrity, create junction tables where needed, and document relationship diagrams for the entire schema

## 5. Implement Indexing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Design optimal indexing approach to ensure database performance
### Details:
Identify frequently queried fields for indexing, prevent potential hotspots in primary key design, balance between read and write performance, implement composite indexes where appropriate, and document indexing decisions with performance considerations
