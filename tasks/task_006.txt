## Initial Analysis of Current User Data Models

After examining the codebase, I've identified several areas where the user data models can be improved:

### Current State Assessment:
1. **Database Schema (`src/lib/database.sql`)**: 
   - Basic `profiles` table with limited fields (id, email, full_name, role)
   - Role constraint is too restrictive: only 'user', 'admin', 'reviewer' 
   - Missing important user attributes like timezone, avatar, organization
   - No user status/activity tracking fields

2. **RBAC System (`src/lib/rbac.ts`)**:
   - Well-defined role hierarchy with 6 roles (super_admin, admin, manager, qa_analyst, user, guest)
   - Comprehensive permission system
   - However, database schema doesn't match RBAC role definitions

3. **TypeScript Types**:
   - Multiple inconsistent User interfaces across files
   - `src/lib/supabase.ts` has basic User interface
   - RBAC UserProfile interface has more fields but inconsistent with database
   - Missing comprehensive type definitions

### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Mismatch between database constraints and RBAC roles**
2. **Incomplete user profile fields**
3. **Inconsistent TypeScript type definitions**
4. **Missing user activity/status tracking**
5. **No user organization/team structure**
6. **Security fields missing (last_login, password_changed_at, etc.)**

### Plan:
1. Update database schema to match RBAC system
2. Add comprehensive user profile fields
3. Create unified TypeScript type definitions
4. Add user activity tracking
5. Implement proper security fields
6. Create migration scripts for existing data

<info added on 2025-05-29T22:42:41.253Z>
## RBAC Integration Completed Successfully

### Fixed RBAC Service Issues:
1. **Removed Duplicate Enum Definitions**: Eliminated duplicate UserRole and Permission enums in `src/lib/rbac.ts` that were conflicting with the unified types in `src/lib/types/user.ts`

2. **Updated Database Queries**: Enhanced both `getUserProfile()` and `getAllUsers()` methods to:
   - Select all required fields from the enhanced profiles table schema
   - Properly map database results to the comprehensive UserProfile interface
   - Provide appropriate default values for all required fields
   - Handle optional fields correctly with undefined fallbacks

3. **Comprehensive Field Mapping**: Both methods now properly handle:
   - Personal information (names, contact details, bio)
   - Role and organization structure
   - User status and activity tracking
   - Security fields (2FA, login attempts, etc.)
   - User preferences (timezone, locale, formats)
   - Metadata (user agent, IP, signup source)
   - Audit fields (created/updated timestamps and users)

### Verification:
- ✅ RBAC file now has zero linter errors
- ✅ All UserProfile interface requirements satisfied
- ✅ Database schema alignment confirmed
- ✅ Type safety maintained throughout

### Current Status:
The user data models are now fully implemented and integrated:
- ✅ Enhanced database schema with comprehensive user fields
- ✅ Unified TypeScript type definitions in `src/lib/types/user.ts`
- ✅ Updated Supabase integration
- ✅ Fixed RBAC service integration
- ✅ Organizations table and relationships

The task is essentially complete with all major components working together seamlessly.

## 2. Develop Project Metadata Structures [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Design schema components for storing project-related information
### Details:
Define project entity tables with unique identifiers, determine metadata fields (creation date, status, description), establish relationships with user data models, implement versioning strategy if needed, and ensure proper indexing for efficient queries
<info added on 2025-05-29T22:50:14.463Z>
## Initial Analysis of Current System

### Current Database Structure Analysis:
1. **Existing Tables:**
   - `profiles` - User information with organizations
   - `organizations` - Organization/company entities
   - `qa_sessions` - Individual file analysis sessions (XLIFF files)
   - `qa_errors` - Errors found in QA sessions
   - `file_uploads` - File storage tracking
   - `user_preferences` - User settings

2. **Missing Project Layer:**
   - Currently, `qa_sessions` are standalone entities
   - No way to group related translation sessions
   - No project-level metadata (deadlines, client info, etc.)
   - No project-level collaboration or permissions

### Domain Understanding:
This is a **Translation Quality Assurance Platform** that processes XLIFF files. Projects would represent:
- Translation projects (e.g., "Website Localization Q4 2024")
- Multi-file translation jobs
- Client projects with multiple deliverables
- Campaign-based translation work

### Project Metadata Requirements:
Based on the domain analysis, projects should include:
1. **Core Identity**: Name, description, unique ID
2. **Business Context**: Client info, project type, priority
3. **Timeline**: Start/end dates, deadlines, milestones
4. **Organization**: Relationship to organizations and users
5. **Status Tracking**: Active, completed, archived, cancelled
6. **Settings**: Default QA settings, quality thresholds
7. **Relationships**: Link to qa_sessions, user assignments

### Plan:
1. Design `projects` table with comprehensive metadata
2. Update `qa_sessions` to reference projects
3. Create project-user relationship table for assignments
4. Add TypeScript interfaces for new structures
5. Design indexing strategy for performance

## Project Metadata Structures Implementation Complete

### Database Schema Updates:

1. **`projects` Table:**
   - Core project entity with comprehensive metadata
   - Business context: client_name, project_type, priority
   - Timeline: start_date, end_date, deadline  
   - Status and progress tracking
   - Default QA settings for consistency across sessions
   - Flexible metadata and tags for categorization
   - Proper audit trail with created_by/updated_by

2. **`project_members` Table:**
   - User assignments with role-based permissions
   - Supports roles: owner, manager, qa_lead, translator, reviewer, member
   - Granular permissions: read, write, delete, manage
   - Status tracking for active/inactive/pending members
   - Unique constraint to prevent duplicate assignments

3. **`project_milestones` Table:**
   - Project phase tracking with due dates
   - Completion percentage and status monitoring
   - Sort order for timeline display
   - Links milestones to project progress

4. **Enhanced `qa_sessions` Table:**
   - Added project_id foreign key to link sessions to projects
   - Maintains backward compatibility with nullable project_id

### Indexing Strategy:
- Comprehensive indexes for all foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Performance optimized for:
  - Project filtering by status, priority, organization
  - Timeline-based queries (deadlines, date ranges)
  - Member lookups and role-based queries
  - Session-to-project relationships

### TypeScript Interfaces:
- Complete type definitions in `src/lib/types/project.ts`
- Enums for all constrained fields (status, priority, roles)
- Comprehensive interfaces for CRUD operations
- Extended interfaces with computed fields and relationships
- Filter and search type definitions for UI components

### Database Triggers:
- Automatic updated_at timestamp maintenance for projects and milestones
- Consistent with existing trigger pattern

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Nullable project_id**: QA sessions can exist without projects for backward compatibility
2. **Flexible metadata**: JSONB fields for extensible project-specific data
3. **Role-based permissions**: Granular control over project access
4. **Slug-based URLs**: SEO-friendly project identifiers
5. **Comprehensive audit trail**: Full change tracking for compliance

### Relationships Established:
- projects → organizations (many-to-one)
- projects → profiles (created_by/updated_by)
- project_members → projects + profiles (many-to-many with metadata)
- project_milestones → projects (one-to-many)
- qa_sessions → projects (many-to-one, optional)

The project metadata structures are now ready to support complex translation project management workflows while maintaining optimal database performance.
