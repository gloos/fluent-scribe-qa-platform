# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement API Integration Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop APIs for integrating with external systems.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure, resources, and operations for each API endpoint, ensuring clarity and consistency. Consider complexity factors such as the number of exposed data objects, their properties, and required validations.
### Details:
List all required endpoints, specify HTTP methods, input/output schemas, and error handling strategies. Use OpenAPI or similar specifications to formalize the design.

## 2. Implement Authentication Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Select and implement appropriate authentication strategies (e.g., API keys, OAuth2, JWT) to secure endpoints and handle multiple authentication scenarios.
### Details:
Document supported authentication flows, handle token validation, and ensure secure storage and transmission of credentials.

## 3. Set Up Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Define and enforce rate limiting policies to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across clients.
### Details:
Determine rate limits per endpoint or user, implement throttling logic, and provide clear error responses for rate limit violations.

## 4. Create Comprehensive API Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Develop clear, up-to-date documentation covering all endpoints, authentication, error codes, and usage guidelines.
### Details:
Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to auto-generate and maintain documentation. Include examples, parameter descriptions, and expected responses.

## 5. Establish API Versioning Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.4
### Description: Define a versioning approach to ensure backward compatibility and smooth evolution of the API.
### Details:
Choose between URI-based, header-based, or parameter-based versioning. Document deprecation policies and migration paths for clients.

## 6. Develop SDKs for Key Platforms [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4, 19.5
### Description: Build and maintain SDKs in popular programming languages to simplify API integration for developers.
### Details:
Ensure SDKs handle authentication, error cases, and versioning. Provide clear usage instructions and update SDKs alongside API changes.

## 7. Provide Integration Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4, 19.6
### Description: Create practical code samples and integration guides demonstrating common API use cases and error handling.
### Details:
Include examples for different authentication flows, handling rate limits, and migrating between API versions. Ensure examples are tested and kept up to date.
