# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework

## Overview

The QA Platform implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control system with 6 hierarchical roles and 18 granular permissions. This document defines each role, their responsibilities, and access levels.

## Role Hierarchy

The system uses a numerical hierarchy system where higher numbers indicate greater privilege levels:

```
SUPER_ADMIN (100) 
    ↓
ADMIN (80)
    ↓  
MANAGER (60)
    ↓
QA_ANALYST (40)
    ↓
USER (20)
    ↓
GUEST (10)
```

## Department-Specific Considerations

### Engineering Department

## Role Assignment Guidelines

### New User Default Roles
- **Internal Employees**: Start as `USER`, promote based on responsibilities
- **Contractors/Temporaries**: Start as `GUEST`, promote as needed
- **Management Hires**: May start as `MANAGER` with approval
- **Technical Leadership**: May start as `QA_ANALYST` with department approval

### Role Elevation Process
1. **USER → QA_ANALYST**: Requires manager approval + QA competency demonstration
2. **QA_ANALYST → MANAGER**: Requires admin approval + leadership assessment
3. **MANAGER → ADMIN**: Requires super admin approval + comprehensive evaluation
4. **ADMIN → SUPER_ADMIN**: Requires existing super admin + board approval

### Role Review Requirements
- **Quarterly**: All GUEST accounts (conversion or deactivation)
- **Semi-Annual**: USER and QA_ANALYST role appropriateness
- **Annual**: MANAGER and ADMIN access review
- **As Needed**: SUPER_ADMIN access (business justification required)

## Security Considerations

### Role Isolation
- Users cannot elevate their own privileges
- Role assignment requires higher privilege level
- Audit logging for all role changes
- Automatic role expiration for temporary assignments

### Permission Inheritance
- Higher roles inherit all permissions of lower roles
- Additional permissions are additive
- No permission subtraction within hierarchy
- Override capabilities only for super admin

### Access Pattern Monitoring
- Regular audit of privilege usage
- Alerting for unusual access patterns
- Compliance reporting capabilities
- Role effectiveness analytics

## Integration Points

### Authentication System
- Role information embedded in JWT tokens
- Session-based role caching (5-minute expiry)
- Real-time role change propagation
- Multi-factor authentication for elevated roles

### API Authorization
- Endpoint-level permission checking
- Resource-level access control
- Query filtering based on role permissions
- Consistent error handling for unauthorized access

### UI Access Control
- Component-level permission checking
- Dynamic menu generation based on roles
- Visual indicators for permission restrictions
- Graceful degradation for insufficient permissions

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Requirements
- All role assignments logged with justification
- Permission usage tracking and reporting
- Regular access review documentation
- Compliance report generation

### Data Retention
- Role change history: 7 years
- Permission usage logs: 3 years
- Access review documentation: 5 years
- Compliance reports: Per regulatory requirements
