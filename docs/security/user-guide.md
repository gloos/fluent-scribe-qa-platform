## Account Security Setup

### Initial Security Configuration

When setting up your account, follow these steps to maximize security:

1. **Create a Strong Password**
   - Use at least 12 characters
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Avoid common patterns and dictionary words
   - The system will check for password breaches automatically

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Set up at least one MFA method during account creation
   - TOTP (authenticator app) is recommended as the primary method
   - Add backup methods (SMS or email) for account recovery

3. **Review Security Settings**
   - Check your security dashboard after account creation
   - Verify all contact information is correct
   - Review and accept security policies

### Account Security Dashboard

Access your security settings through:
- **Web App**: Profile → Security Settings
- **API**: `GET /api/v1/security/user/profile`

The security dashboard shows:
- Current MFA status and configured methods
- Recent security events and login history
- Device management and fingerprinting status
- Password security status and recommendations
- Active sessions and access tokens

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Available MFA Methods

#### 1. TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) - **Recommended**
- Use authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
- Generates time-based codes that change every 30 seconds
- Works offline and provides the highest security

**Setup Process:**
1. Navigate to Security Settings → Multi-Factor Authentication
2. Select "TOTP / Authenticator App"
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
4. Enter the 6-digit code to verify setup
5. Save the backup codes in a secure location

#### 2. SMS (Text Message)
- Receive verification codes via text message
- Requires a valid mobile phone number
- Good backup method but less secure than TOTP

**Setup Process:**
1. Go to Security Settings → Multi-Factor Authentication
2. Select "SMS / Text Message"
3. Enter and verify your mobile phone number
4. Test the setup by requesting a verification code

#### 3. Email
- Receive verification codes via email
- Uses your registered email address
- Useful as a backup method

**Setup Process:**
1. Navigate to Security Settings → Multi-Factor Authentication
2. Select "Email Verification"
3. Verify your email address is correct
4. Test the setup by requesting a verification code

### Managing MFA Settings

#### Adding Multiple Methods
- Set up multiple MFA methods for redundancy
- TOTP should be your primary method
- Keep at least one backup method active

#### Backup Codes
- Generate and store backup codes securely
- Each code can only be used once
- Keep them in a secure password manager or offline location
- Generate new codes if you use several existing ones

#### Disabling MFA
⚠️ **Warning**: Only disable MFA if absolutely necessary
1. Verify your identity using current MFA method
2. Contact support if you've lost access to all MFA methods
3. Temporary access may be granted with additional verification

## Password Security

### Password Requirements

The system enforces strong password requirements:
- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- **Complexity**: Must include at least 3 of the following:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- **Breach Protection**: Passwords are checked against known breach databases
- **Pattern Detection**: Common patterns and dictionary words are rejected

### Password Security Features

#### Breach Monitoring
- Automatic checking against HaveIBeenPwned database
- Real-time verification during password creation/change
- Notifications if your password appears in new breaches
- Immediate password reset required if breach detected

#### Password Strength Assessment
The system provides real-time feedback on password strength:
- **Entropy Calculation**: Mathematical measure of password randomness
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies and warns about common patterns
- **Dictionary Checking**: Prevents use of common words and phrases
- **Personal Information**: Warns against using personal information

#### Secure Password Reset

**Self-Service Reset:**
1. Click "Forgot Password" on login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check email for reset link (expires in 1 hour)
4. Create new password meeting security requirements
5. All existing sessions are invalidated

**Rate Limiting Protection:**
- Limited number of reset attempts per hour
- Progressive delays for repeated attempts
- Account lockout after excessive failed attempts

### Password Best Practices

1. **Use a Password Manager**
   - Generate unique, complex passwords for each account
   - Avoid reusing passwords across services
   - Let the password manager remember passwords for you

2. **Regular Password Updates**
   - Change passwords if you suspect compromise
   - Update passwords for critical accounts quarterly
   - Don't change passwords unnecessarily often

3. **Avoid Common Mistakes**
   - Don't use personal information in passwords
   - Avoid keyboard patterns (qwerty, 123456)
   - Don't write passwords on paper or in unsecured files

## Session Management
